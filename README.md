# AngularJS-mini-app

My intention was to use this example I got in:
http://tutorialzine.com/2013/08/learn-angularjs-5-examples/ and play
around with the ng-click directive; using toggleActive and ng-hide and ng-show.
I got bogged down in defining $scope and trying to get the toggleActive to work.

I did can get the total to add every coffee item up and display the total.

When down a few rabbit holes.  Watched an hour long how to build an Angular app in
code school that was so...good.  Thought I would follow their lead and went with the
Angular examples instead.
